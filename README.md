## Birth
At first, my purpose of creating this project was making a program to manage the
financial activities;
So I started and when I finished programming, I felt that I can learn a lot of things by developing this program and improve my skills, so I started developing and I put it in GitHub.

## Introduction
In this PC app called "Capital Management", you can register your financial transactions and see some details about your capital. 
This program contains a GUI (Graphical User Interface) designs with Qt5, a database that is mysql and some source codes written with python.

## How to run
To easy run (for the users or someone who wants to test the app), I am trying to put a .exe file in the project's folder, but it seems that there is a problem related to database module; so there is no .exe file yet.
If you want to develop it or see its source codes(or the only way to run this program till now üòê), you can run the "app.py" with your favorite IDE or a command prompt.
Just make sure that the host, username and the password of the mysql database(that is specified in "options.py", in "Options" class) of the code is synced with your own database.

## Used tools
- **Programming language**: Python
- **Database**: MySQL
- **GUI**: Qt5

## TODO
- [ ] Solve the problem of database module.
- [ ] Create a .exe file for the program. 
- [ ] Sync the database with all the different situations.
